Control Variates Methods
------------------------

### MC with Control Variate

-   We want to price an exotic option with payoff function $f(X)$ by MC
    simulation.

-   We know the exact value $g^*$ of a vanilla option with payoff
    $g(X)$.

### MC with Control Variate

Solve the least-square problem:
$$\min_{\beta} \sum_i \left( f(X^i) + \beta (g^* - g(X^i)) \right)$$

$\beta$ is the regression coefficient of $f(X)$ on $g(X)$.
