Improving the Accuracy of MC Pricing
------------------------------------

### Methods for improving the convergence of Monte-Carlo simulations

-   Antithetic variables: draw random numbers symetrically around the
    mean to ensure that the sample mean is accurate.

-   Use random number generators (Sobol) that generate well-distributed
    samples, regardless of sample size.

-   Use Control Variate methods

### MC with antithetic variables. Price vs. number of simulations

variables](Figures/fig-fig-mc-61)

### Comparison of Sobol sequence and default uniform random variates

### Summary

-   Variance of MC estimator is a function of $\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}}$.

-   The quality of the random number generator has a major impact on the
    accuracy of the MC estimation.

Control Variates Methods
------------------------

### MC with Control Variate

A and B are very similar derivatives, function of the same risk factors
$X$. We know the exact value of B: $f_B$.

1.  Compute the values of $f^*_B = E(f_B(X))$ and $f^*_A = E(f_A(X))$ by
    MC simulation.

2.  The quantity $e = f_B - f^*_B$ is a measure of the MC simulation
    bias

3.  Use this measure to correct the MC price of A:
    $$f_A = f^*_A + (f_B - f^*_B)$$
