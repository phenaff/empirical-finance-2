# Deterministic Time-Varying Volatility

```{r, echo=FALSE,results='hide'}

In some markets, the term structure of volatility has a specific
pattern. Many commodities have a seasonal pattern: Natural gas, for
example, is in high demand in the winter, but its supply is limited by
the capacity of the pipeline network, and this increases price
volatility during the heating season. In this chapter, we present and
estimate models that are suited to such markets.

## Gabillonâ€™s Model

Dynamics of forward prices

Let $F(t, T)$ be the value at time $t$ of a futures contract expiring at
$T$. Assume a two factor model for the dynamic of the futures prices:

$$\label{eq:gabillon}
\frac{dF(t,T)}{F(t,T)} = B(t,T) \sigma_S dW_S + (1-B(t,T)) \sigma_L dW_L$$

with $$\begin{aligned}
B(t,T) & = & e^{-\beta (T-t)} \\
<dW_S, dW_L> & = & \rho\end{aligned}$$

The variance of $\ln(F(t,T))$ is given by:

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Var}[\ln(F(t,T)] & = &\sigma_S^2 \int_0^t e^{-2\beta(T-u)} du + \sigma_L^2 \int_0^t (1-e^{-\beta(T-u)})^2 du + \\
& & 2 \rho \sigma_S \sigma_L \int_0^t e^{-\beta(T-u)} du\end{aligned}$$

Average variance to expiry is:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
\text{Var}[ln(F(T,T)] & = \frac{\sigma_S^2}{2\beta} (1-e^{-2\beta T}) + \sigma_L^2(T - \frac{2}{\beta} (1-e^{-2\beta T})) + \\
& \frac{\rho \sigma_L \sigma_S}{\beta} (1 - 2e^{-\beta T} + e^{-2 \beta T}) \\
& = V(T, \sigma_S, \sigma_L, \rho, \beta)
\end{array}$$

Hybrid Calibration

Estimate $\rho$ and $\sigma_L$ historically ($\rho = .87$,
$\sigma_L = .12$), calibrate $\sigma_S$ and $\beta$ to implied ATM
volatility.

Forward Volatility by Contract

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Var}[\ln(F(t_1, t_2,T)] & = &\sigma_S^2 \int_{t_1}^{t_2} e^{-2\beta(T-u)} du + \sigma_L^2 \int_{t_1}^{t_2} (1-e^{-\beta(T-u)})^2 du + \\
& & 2 \rho \sigma_S \sigma_L \int_{t_1}^{t_2} e^{-\beta(T-u)} du\end{aligned}$$
