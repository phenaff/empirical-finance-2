`r tufte::newthought("Ten")` years after the first edition, it is time to
revisit this text, not only to update the data sets, but also the add material
that didn't make it the first time around.

So much has taken place since the 2011. Publishing open source
material has become dramatically simpler with the development of the
`r to_index("bookdown", "packages")` package and the possibility of generating an online version of the
text.

Alas, there was also tragedy. In 2016 Diethelm Wurtz and his wife Barbara
were involved in a fatal accident. Diethelm was the founder of the Rmetrics association,
the author of the Rmetrics suite of packages, and the organizer of the
R/Rmetrics Summer Schools and Workshops.
We hold fond memories of these wonderful workshops organized in
Meielisalp, and this second edition is dedicated to the memory of Barbara and Diethelm.

```{block, type='epigraph'}
Une totale soumission aux données de l'expérience \
est la règle d'or qui domine toute discipline, \
toute activité valable. \
---Maurice Allais
```

`r newthought("This")` textbook is about empirical finance, and focusses on the pricing and risk management of financial assets: bonds, futures contracts, and other derivative securities.

The emphasis of this text is empirical. We present models, and verify their relevance by testing them of real data. We emphasize:

- an incremental approach to model building, starting from simple models, and building upon that foundation to construct more complex models, as needed,
- a data-driven approach: we will implement all the models that are presented, using the R statistical package and the Rmetrics libraries,
- the systematic use of simulation as a way of validating modeling decisions.

Last but not least, a particular attention is given to model estimation, in order to measure the tradeoff between model complexity and the challenges of a robust calibration.

This course would not be possible without the \RR{} statistical program and without the Rmetrics packages. We extend our deep appreciation to the \RR{} community and to Diethelm Wuertz and the Rmetrics team.
