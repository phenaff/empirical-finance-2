`r newthought("This")` textbook is about empirical finance, and focusses on the pricing and risk management of financial assets: bonds, futures contracts, and other derivative securities.

The emphasis of this text is empirical. We present models, and verify their relevance by testing them of real data. We emphasize:

\begin{itemize}
\item an incremental approach to model building, starting from simple models, and building upon that foundation to construct more complex models, as needed,
\item a data-driven approach: we will implement all the models that are presented, using the R statistical package and the Rmetrics libraries,
\item the systematic use of simulation as a way of validating modeling decisions.
\end{itemize}

Last but not least, a particular attention is given to model estimation, in order to measure the tradeoff between model complexity and the challenges of a robust calibration.

This course would not be possible without the \RR{} statistical program and without the Rmetrics packages. We extend our deep appreciation to the \RR{} community and to Diethelm Wuertz and the Rmetrics team.
