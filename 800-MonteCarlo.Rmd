# Monte Carlo Simulations

The most common use of Monte Carlo methods in finance is the computation of the expected value of some function $f(x_)$
given the density $\phi(x)$ of the variable of interest.

------------------------

### Monte-Carlo Simulations

Monte-Carlo Simulation: generation of time series of risk factors that
are consistent with the observed behavior of these risk factors, or with
a model.

The time series are obtained by repeated random sampling of the risk
factors, according to a specified probability distribution.

Name due to von Neumann, Ulam and Metropolis (1946) while working on US
defense projects.

### Use of Monte-Carlo Simulations

Simulations are used for:

-   Risk measurement:

    -   Scenario analysis, VaR

    -   Stress testing (Basel II, Solvency II)

-   Derivatives pricing

    -   Easy to implement (just code the payoff formula)

    -   Flexible: it dissociates the dynamics of the risk factors from
        the evaluation of the option.

### Historical vs. Risk-Neutral Probabilities

-   Historical or objective probabilities:

    -   The “real-world” behavior of the asset

    -   Consistent with observed historical time series

    -   Each asset has its own expected return

-   Risk-Neutral probabilities;

    -   The distribution consistent with option prices

    -   The expected return of all assets is the risk-free rate

### Historical vs. Risk-Neutral Probabilities

-   A stock has an annualized expected return of $\mu=5\%$ and an
    annualized s.d. of return $\sigma = 30\%$.

-   The risk-free rate is $r=2\%$.

Simulation of $S_T$: stock price at horizon $T$:

-   Consistent with historical probabilities: $$\begin{aligned}
    E\left[\frac{S_T}{S_0}\right] &=& e^{\mu T} \\
    V\left[\ln\left(\frac{S_T}{S_0}\right)\right] &=& \sigma^2 T\end{aligned}$$

-   Consistent with risk-neutral probabilities $$\begin{aligned}
    E\left[\frac{S_T}{S_0}\right] &=& e^{r T} \\
    V\left[\ln\left(\frac{S_T}{S_0}\right)\right] &=& \sigma^2 T\end{aligned}$$

### Monte-Carlo Simulations: Historical vs. Risk-Neutral

-   Simulations for scenario analysis and VaR are based on actual
    probabilities (historical VaR)

-   Simulations for pricing are based on risk-neutral probabilities.

-   Economic scenarii generation for Solvency II calculations use hybrid
    methods.

    -   Market consistent

    -   Use historical data when implied volatility from option market
        is not available

LogNormal Property of Asset Prices
----------------------------------

### Distribution of Stock Returns

Notation:

$S_t$

:   Price of asset at time $t$

$z_t$

:   Growth rate from $t-1$ to $t$

Growth rate in interval $[0, t]$: $$\begin{aligned}
R_t &=& \frac{S_t}{S_0} \\
&=& z_1 \times z_2 \times \ldots \times z_t \\
\ln (R_t) &=& \sum_{i=1}^t \ln (z_i)\end{aligned}$$

### Distribution of Stock Returns

Assume:

-   $z_i$ are independent, identically distributed

-   $E\left[ \ln (z_i) \right] = m$

-   $V\left[ \ln (z_i) \right] = \sigma^2$

By Central Limit Theorem:

-   $\sum_{i=1}^t ln z_i \approx N(m t, \sigma \sqrt{t})$

-   $R_t= \frac{S_t}{S_0} $ is log-normal

-   $E\left[ \frac{S_t}{S_0} \right] = e^{(m + \frac{\sigma^2}{2})t}$

### Distribution of Stock Return

Assume that the continuously compounded expected rate of rate is $\mu$.

Therefore:

$$\begin{aligned}
\mu &=& m + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \\
m &=& \mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\end{aligned}$$

$$\ln \left( \frac{S_t}{S_0} \right) \approx N((\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2})t, \sigma \sqrt{t})$$

### Simulation of Stock Price

Exact simulation, good for all $t$: $$\begin{aligned}
\ln ( S_{t} ) &=& \ln (S_0)  + x_t \\
x_t & \approx & \mathcal{N}((\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}) t,  \sigma^2t) \\
x_t & = & (\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}) t + \sigma \sqrt{t} \epsilon \\
\epsilon & \approx & \mathcal{N}(0,1)   \end{aligned}$$

### How to Choose $\mu$?

-   In a risk-neutral world, for option pricing, $\mu$ is the risk-free
    rate: $$E(S_t) = S_0 e^{rt}$$

-   For scenario analysis, historical VaR, $\mu$ is the historical or
    expected rate of return. $$E(S_t) = S_0 e^{\mu t}$$

### What about $(\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2})$

Consider the following sequence of annual realize returns in 5
consecutive years:

   Year   Return (%)
  ------ ------------
    1         15
    2         20
    3         30
    4        -20
    5         25

### What is the Expected Rate of Return?

The mean return is $14\%$. However, the actual return over 5 years is
not identical to 5 years of average return: $$\begin{aligned}
100 \times 1.15 \times 1.20 \times 1.30 \times 0.80 \times 1.25 = 179.40 \\
100 \times 1.14^4 = 192.54\end{aligned}$$

Actual average rate of growth: $$1.7940^{\frac{1}{5}} - 1 = .124$$

### Simulating a Log-Normal Process: Summary

Given a stock with expected continuous compounded return $\mu$:

$$\ln(S_t) - \ln(S_0) \approx \mathcal{N}\left((\mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2)t, \sigma^2 t\right)$$

or $$S_{t} = S_0 \exp \left[ \left(\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2})
  \right) t + \sigma \sqrt{t} \epsilon \right]$$

with $\epsilon \approx \mathcal{N}(0,1)$.

### How to simulate a log-normal process

To simulate a time series of stock prices following a log-normal
process, observed at intervals $\Delta t$:

1.  Start with $S_0$ at $t=0$

2.  for $t=\Delta t, 2 \Delta t, \ldots, T$:

    1.  Simulate $\epsilon \approx \mathcal{N}(0,1): \epsilon_t$

    2.  Compute
        $$S_t = S_{t-\Delta t} e^{\left(r - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right) \Delta t + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t} \epsilon_t}$$

### Simulation of a Log-Normal Process: Example

![Risk-neutral log normal process,
$S_0 = 100, T=1, r=10\%, \sigma=30\%$](Figures/fig-fig-price-plot)

### How to Generate Normal Random Numbers $\epsilon \approx \mathcal{N}(0,1)$

Use the Central Limit Theorem:

$$\epsilon = \sum_{i=1}^{12} R_i -6$$

where $R_i$ are independent uniform random numbers between 0 and 1.

$$\begin{aligned}
V(R_i) &=& E(R_i^2) - E(R_i)^2 \\
 &=& \frac{1}{3} - \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{12}\end{aligned}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
E(\epsilon) &=& 12 E(R_i) - 6 = 0 \\
V(\epsilon) &=& 12 V(R_i) = 1\end{aligned}$$

### How to Generate Normal Random Numbers $\epsilon$

Using a uniform $[0,1]$ random generator:

1.  Draw $z \approx \mbox{uniform}(0,1)$

2.  transform $z$ into a normal variable
    $\epsilon \approx \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ $$\epsilon = N^{-1}(z)$$ where
    $N()$ is the cumulative normal distribution.

Proof:

$$\begin{aligned}
Pr\{\epsilon \leq x\} &=& Pr\{ N^{-1}(z) \leq x\} \\
 &=& Pr\{ N(N^{-1}(z)) \leq N(x) \} \\
&=& Pr\{z \leq N(x) \} \\
&=& N(x)\end{aligned}$$

### Monte Carlo Simulation: Introductory Example

Estimating $\pi$ by randomly throwing darts at the square.

Area of square: $\frac{\pi}{4}$.

### Computing circle area by simulation

1.  Simulate $N$ throws of dart

2.  Count the number of darts that land in the circle, let $M$ be that
    number

3.  Estimate for $\pi$ is: $$\pi = 4 \frac{M}{N}$$

### Estimation error

Accuracy, measured by standard deviation, improves at the rate
$\sqrt{N}$.

To reduce error by a factor of 10, one needs the increase the number of
simulations by a factor of 100.

This slow convergence rate has motivated research on how to improve the
accuracy of the simulation by other means than increasing the number of
simulations.
